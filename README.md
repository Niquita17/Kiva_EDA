This is a part of exploratory data analysis of Kiva financial company. 
Kiva is an international credit company where people from developing countries can request a loan for any amount of money and any needs.
After placing an application the Kiva's community sponsors it and as soon as the full amount is collected the borrower receives the money.


I did some particular parts of the analysis as one of the training tasks on real data.
